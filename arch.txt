Entities
--------


1) Human
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Properties ( 0.0 to 1.0 )

a) Health (0 to 1.0)
b) Wealth (0 to infinity)
c) Assets (0 to infinity) - represents land etc

Behavior

a) Survival
Wealth reduces by X, if wealth reaches 0, health reduces. 
X is inversely proportional to health - meaning unhealthy people need more wealth to survive - treatment, medicines etc.

b) Production (assume farming model)
Wealth increases per production cycle, proportional to Health * Assets 
The healthier you are the more you can produce 
The more assets you have, the more you can produce
See Environment for more details

c) Interaction

There are several effects of interaction.
Each sides wealth or health can increase or decrease


- Relationship/Social contact : Both parties health increases 
- Business : Both parties wealth increases 

- Violent crime : One parties health decreases
- Bad luck : One parties wealth decreases

- White collar crime : One parties wealth decreases others increases
- Dependency/Care : One parties health decreases others increases

- Altercation - Both parties health decreases
- Litigation - Both parties wealth decreases


For simplicity we will just randomly choose what any interaction results in.
We can use a distribution of these 8 interactions that defines what kind of a society it is

In future, the societies distribution of interactions changes based on average health and wealth of all the individuals.
This is how it works in real life - as societies progress, there are less health based interactions like fistfights and more wealth based ones. As they progress more, there is increase of win/win transactions over win/lose transactions.


2) Environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is fixed amount of environment (read land area)

The land is used by humans to create wealth, by putting in health.
Land has an effort co-efficient, which is the ratio of health to wealth.
Each time it is "farmed"  or "mined", the effort co-eff increases
Each production cycle that it is left untouched, the co-eff decreases

The balance between this + and - can define whether its a 100% renewable resource like a food farm, or a 100% non renewable one like a coal farm.
